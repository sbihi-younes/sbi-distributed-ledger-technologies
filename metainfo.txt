Name of Quantlet: sbi Distributed Ledger Technologies

Published in: Blockchains, Crypto Currencies, Network Analytics (WS 25/26) Class

Description:
This Quantlet implements a minimal distributed ledger (DLT) simulation in Python.
Four nodes (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave) maintain local blockchains with signed
transactions, majority-vote consensus, replay protection via nonces and tx_ids,
and account-balance state updates. The code demonstrates how blocks are formed
(index, prev_hash, transactions, hash), how consensus is reached, and verifies
that all nodes end with identical blockchains, identical balances, and conserved
total supply.

Keywords:

Submitted: Pending

Datafile: None (all transactions are generated synthetically in the code)

Input:
No external input is required. The Quantlet uses a fixed random seed to generate
a sequence of synthetic transactions between four accounts.

Output:
Console summary of blockchain height per node, final balances per node,
and internal consistency checks (equality of chains, equality of balances,
and conservation of total supply). Optionally, a PNG plot of final balances
(Balances.png) can be saved.

Example:
Run sbi-Distributed-Ledger-Technologies.py. The script prints:
- Blockchain height for each node (same number of blocks),
- Final balances for Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave (identical across nodes),
- Total supply (unchanged from initial state).
If plotting is enabled, Balances.png shows the final account balances.
